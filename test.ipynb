      "The journey of Bayesian probability began in the mid-18th century with Reverend Thomas Bayes, who formulated an initial theorem on updating beliefs based on new evidence. Despite his groundbreaking work being initially overlooked and buried by academia due to prevailing views against subjectivity, it laid the foundation for a revolutionary approach in decision-making under uncertainty.\n",
      "\n",
      "Pierre Simon Laplace independently rediscovered Bayes' insights around 1774 while grappling with vast amounts of data. His application led him to draw conclusions on natural laws such as sex ratios, showcasing the potential and power of this methodology in practical terms beyond theoretical boundaries.\n",
      "\n",
      "During a period when academia dismissed Laplace's work for being too subjective during its early development stages, it was actually practitioners who turned to Bayesian methods out of necessity due to their effectiveness at solving real-world problems and emergencies. A notable instance occurred in the Second World War where Alan Turing applied these principles within his cryptographic efforts against Enigmaâ€”an endeavor which had significant ramifications, not only for military intelligence but also on paving way towards modern computing technologies.\n",
      "\n",
      "The book \"The Theory That Would Not Die\" by Sharon Bertsch McGrayne delves into the intricacies of Bayesian probability's resurrection and acceptance throughout history up to its triumphant status in contemporary settings, including fields such as medical statistics where it helps measure evidence strength or e-commerce with algorithms for recommending products.\n",
      "\n",
      "In conclusion, what started off as a contentious theoretical principle eventually became an indispensable tool during the Second World War and has since maintained relevance across various domains thanks to its robustness in dealing with uncertainty through objective data analysis. This evolution reflects not only advances made by mathematicians like Laplace but also practical applications that underscored Bayes' rule as a vital component of rational decision-making amidst incomplete information, thereby cementing it into the bedrock of numerous scientific and technological developments in our modern world.\n"

      "Alan Turing arrived in Bletchley Park where he was involved with various Enigma systems initially working on army codes before shifting his focus to German naval codes, which were more complex. He played a key role in the development of an electromechanical machine known as \"bombe.\" This device dramatically increased efficiency by testing every possible wheel arrangement for enemy messages rapidly compared to manual methods. Turing's bombe significantly advanced British code-breaking capabilities and was essential when Bletchley Park faced increasingly sophisticated German Enigma machines during the war, particularly concerning naval codes vital in combating U-boat threats.\n",
      "Throughout his time at Bletchley Park, Turing also engaged with colleagues like Gordon Welchman and Harold \"Doc\" Keen to refine bombe's design further into a metal cabinet prototype that was critical for deciphering the naval codes effectively. The machine utilized Bayesian scoring methods based on bans which later proved instrumental in improving subsequent Colossi models, contributing not only to immediate wartime efforts but also laying groundwork principles still relevant today within computer science and artificial intelligence fields where he pursued his interests alongside cryptanalysis work during the war.\n",
